Shopping Cart System - Project Explanation
<br>


This project is a simple command-line shopping cart system developed in Python using dictionaries
and lists.

<br><br>
Main Features:

• Display a catalog of items (stored in a dictionary with prices and discount eligibility).

• Add items to a cart (dictionary with quantities).

• Update or remove items from the cart.

• Calculate total cost with a discount logic: Buy 3 Get 1 Free (for some items).

• Print a final invoice showing item, quantity, and price breakdown.

Discount Logic:

For products marked eligible, every 4 items will be charged as 3. E.g., if 4 apples are bought, 1 is
free.
